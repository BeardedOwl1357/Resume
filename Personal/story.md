# My story

## Obsesion with Game Development

I chose engineering and by consequence, computer science as my major because of my obsession with being a game developer. Since I was 5, I have been playing video games and that had got me interested in computers with the intention of being a game developer. In my high school and first year of college, I experimented with 3D modelling and gameplay programming, ultimately settling for gameplay programming in unreal engine 4. In college, I was primarily focused with learning these game development fundamentals and keeping my cgpa decent. I was obsessed with it. I didn't spend time socialising or attending new events, just me and my craft. 

In 2020, during Covid lockdown, I found a group of 5-6 members in discord who were a part of an early stage startup focusing on architectural visualizations and educational games. They were eager to provide me with an unpaid internship as a gameplay programmer which I whole heartedly accepted. In a remote setting, we worked together to create proof-of-concepts for clients CEO was trying to target. We also participated in game jams, a hackathon like event but for game developers to gain exposure. 

I was in the team for 6 months and two things happened 
- I lost my obsession with game development. I had romanticised this in my childhood and these rose tinted glasses broke when I realised that psychological manipulation is used to make players feel that "they are doing good". What I considered skill and actual joy in my childhood was product of someone's manipulation. I couldn't digest it and I lost my spark
- The startup was not able to provide the deliverables as per client's expectation and the team decided to part ways.

## Losing my spark

With this, I got lost. The thing that kept me going was destroyed. I just focused on college deliverables but in due time, the companies were coming to campus for placement. I knew that I am capable of software engineering , even though not obsessed about it. I decided to pivot to software engineering and eventually landed a software engineering internship and job at Oracle 

I had this expectation that if I work in corporate, I might get an idea of what I want for my career. I devoted all my time to what the project demanded, both in my internship and for the first year in Oracle as well. I quickly learnt and adapted to the tech stack and practices used and was able to reach to a point where I was confident with my skills. I fixed issues which others didn't, worked with multiple teams in different codebases. Yet, I couldn't find my answer. 

## Identity crisis

I had been giving CAT just for the sake of it, like a lottery ticket where I knew that I wouldn't get a 99 percentile (which is required for admissions in IIM's). I decided to apply to a college called Master's union which surprisingly accepted me. I was invited with other accepted participants for a weekend at college and it was a lovely experience. However, I didn't accept the admit. 

It took me some retrospection to arrive at the following conclusions 
1. I had an identity crisis when I was given the admission letter to the MBA college. I just couldn't shake off the identity of being an engineer, a programmer. 
2. It had been 2 years and I didn't have a clue what I wanted. Ever since I lost my spark in 2021 about game development, I never found the answer. With my current situation, I got sure that unless I change something, I will never get the answer
3. My visit to the master's unions campus expanded my worldview. I just thought that an MBA degree will make me someone who handles jira tickets and does social media campaigns or call people to sell them something. Instead, I saw an intersection of human psychology, finance and innovation. I thought that once someone graduates from an MBA college, they can never get back to tech but there, I just heard the line "found a tech company. Get a CTO and work with them to build whatever you want". Such a simple statement yet so profound to me. 
4. With how AI is growing, generalists are going to be really useful. I feel that awareness and experiences are going to be more important than raw knowledge. MBA, or any engagement where I wear multiple hats, will benefit me in the long run

## Bouncing back

Now determined to evolve my identity from "an engineer and a programmer", I am doing what I need to. 

1. **Learning frontend and ux design** : I want to build apps and full applications (instead of the backend API level work I do)

2. **Learning video editing** : I was looking to volunteer and saw that many NGO's had opening for video editors and graphic designers. I feel like small businesses and NGO's will benefit from video editors

3. **Professional certificate of product management** : I want to learn more about building products, especially the business side.

4. **Preparing for gmat, cat and xat** : These are my entry tickets to admission to top management colleges of India
